```

Generate Abudncance table from erlandson raw dataset

ID by tree ("Ind" column)
Relativize ectoID by tree (eg communuity at tree/site was 20% (.20 or 20?) Laccaria) and by counts of Ecto_spp and divide by number of unique root tips at the tree (~12/tree, expect fewer)

spp matrix = per tree abund data
trait matrix = per tree trait data

-paste to combo.matrix your data to generate species NMDS 
Structure of end dataset is:
  - 
  
```{r}

```
